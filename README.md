# 🧠 TechVerse Infrastructure Lab

Welcome to **TechVerse Infrastructure Lab**, a fully documented, hands-on infrastructure simulation environment designed for mastering enterprise-grade IT operations, system architecture, hybrid cloud integrations, and cybersecurity practices. This lab mirrors real-world infrastructure and follows industry best practices across on-premises, cloud, and security domains.

## 🎯 Purpose

This lab is built as a **learning and showcase platform** for IT professionals, infrastructure engineers, and DevSecOps practitioners to simulate and understand how enterprise networks and systems are designed, deployed, and managed securely in a hybrid environment.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- Enterprise network design with VLANs and inter-VLAN routing
- FortiGate firewall rule simulation and segmentation
- Windows Server AD DS, DNS, DHCP failover with group policy
- Azure AD sync and Intune MDM for hybrid identity
- Proxmox-based hypervisor and virtual environment setup
- Linux (Ubuntu) servers for monitoring and logging (Zabbix, Graylog)
- TrueNAS storage with ZFS replication
- Backup & DR strategy (Veeam, Rsync, Rclone, S3 replication)
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for infrastructure automation
- Secure remote access using VPN and role-based IAM
- On-premise services (WSUS, DFS, PDQ Deploy) and internal tools (Moodle, BookStack)
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and Ansible
- End-to-end ITSM alignment (GLPI, Freshservice)
